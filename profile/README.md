# DomeHQ 👋  
**The home for building mini-apps on Dome**

Welcome to **DomeHQ**, the official GitHub organization for **Dome** — a platform to create **instant, lightweight mini-apps for anything**.

Dome lets anyone create an app-like space (called a *dome*) in seconds — no installs, no app stores, no code required.

> **There’s a mini-app for that.**

---

## 🌍 What is Dome?

A **dome** is a small, private mini-app that can combine:
- chat & discussions  
- photos & files  
- posts & updates  
- maps & live locations  
- contacts & structured data  
- custom tools (“cards”)

All in one place.

People use domes for:
- families & friend groups  
- classes & institutions  
- teams & projects  
- communities & clubs  
- events, NGOs, and small businesses  

If something needs coordination or shared context — it probably needs a dome.

## 🧠 Why Dome exists

Most real-world initiatives don’t justify a *full app* —  
but chat groups, spreadsheets, and random tools don’t scale either.

Dome sits in the middle:
- **lighter than apps**
- **richer than chat**
- **mobile-first**
- **phone-number based**
- **instant & persistent**

## 👩‍💻 For Developers: Why you should care

Dome is also a **mini-app platform**.

Developers can build **cards** — small, focused tools that plug into domes:
- expense trackers  
- attendance tools  
- booking systems  
- forms & workflows  
- domain-specific utilities  

Key ideas:
- Cards feel *native* inside domes
- They can work **offline**
- No separate user login flows
- User context is securely passed by the host
- One card → usable across thousands of domes

Think of it as:
> *“Build once. Instantly usable everywhere.”*

## 📦 What lives in this GitHub org

You’ll find:
- Starter templates for building Dome cards
- Reference implementations
- Open discussions on architecture & APIs

Some repos are early, some are production-ready — all are evolving.

---

## 🚀 Getting started

If you’re new:
1. Start by understanding what a **dome** and a **card** are
2. Explore the SDK / example repos
3. Build a small, single-purpose tool
4. See it come alive inside a dome

We’re intentionally keeping things simple and extensible.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We’re early — and that’s a feature.

If you:
- enjoy building developer platforms
- care about mobile-first users
- like clean abstractions
- want to help shape a new ecosystem

…you’re very welcome here.

Issues, discussions, ideas, and PRs are encouraged.

## 🔴 A note on philosophy

Dome is not about hype, trends, or slogans.  
It grows **not by slogans, but by everyday use** — by people solving real problems.

If you’re building for real humans, in real contexts, on real phones —  
you’re in the right place.

**Happy building.**  
— Team Dome
