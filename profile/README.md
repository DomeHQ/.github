# DomeHQ 👋  
**The home for building mini-apps on Dome**

Welcome to **DomeHQ**, the official GitHub organization for **Dome** — a platform to create **instant, lightweight mini-apps for anything**.

On Dome, people create and run **mini-apps** we call **domes** — small, app-like spaces built for a specific purpose.

> **There’s a mini-app for that.**

---

## 🌍 What is Dome?

**Dome** is a mobile-first platform that lets anyone create their own mini-app, called a **dome**, in seconds.

A **dome** can combine:
- chat & discussions  
- photos & files  
- posts & updates  
- maps & live locations  
- contacts & structured data  
- custom tools (“cards”)

All in one place — without juggling multiple chat apps or fragmented tools.

---

## 🧠 Why Dome exists

Most real-world initiatives don’t justify building a full app —  but chat apps alone aren’t enough either.

Dome sits in the middle:
- **lighter than apps**
- **richer than chat**
- **mobile-first**
- **phone-number based**
- **instant & persistent**

Each initiative gets its own dome.  
Each dome stays focused on what it was created for.

## 👩‍💻 For Developers: where you fit in

Dome is also a **mini-app platform**.

Developers build **cards** — small, focused tools that plug into domes.

Examples:
- expense trackers  
- attendance tools  
- booking systems  
- forms & workflows  
- domain-specific utilities  

Key ideas:
- Cards run *inside domes*
- They feel native inside the Dome app
- User context is securely passed by the platform
- No separate login or auth flows needed
- Same code runs across Android, iPhone and Web (PC / Mac)
- Cards can work **offline**
- One card can be used across **thousands of domes**

Think of it as:
> *Build once. Instantly usable everywhere.*

## 📦 What lives in this GitHub org

You’ll find:
- Reference card implementations for React and Angular
- Tooling, docs, and experiments

Some repos are early, some are production-ready — all are evolving. Make sure you join the Dome Developer community here: https://dome.so/developer .

## 🚀 Getting started

If you’re new:

1. Install the **Dome app** on your phone 
   👉 https://dome.so/download
   
2. Create or join a dome to understand how mini-apps work in practice


To start developing for Dome:

1. Join the "Dome Developer" community dome (to interact with us, updates, etc.)
   👉 https://dome.so/developer
   
2. Explore the example card starter repositories here on GitHub

3. Build a small, single-purpose card and see it come alive inside a dome
   - Go to the "Dome Developer" dome, create a new card
   - Clone, build and deploy from one of the card starter repos
  
4. Add the newly creatd card to a dome and see it come alive across Android, iPhone and web!

5. Modify the code to your heart's content and build whatever you can think of!

We intentionally keep the platform simple, extensible, and real-world friendly.

## 🔴 A note on philosophy

Dome doesn’t grow by hype or slogans.

It grows **not by slogans, but by everyday use** —  
by people creating domes for real needs.

If you’re building for real humans, in real contexts, on real phones —  
you’re in the right place.

**Happy building.**  
— Team Dome
